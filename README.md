## Reasoning
I recently watched a video from [Eric Parker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN6VyYOfLIk) on YouTube which is fairly old, but made me realize that applications like this should be readily available without having to run the risk of having malware installed on your system.

That being said, this application achieves that, and soon, much more.
## Requirements
* DirectX11
* Windows Version to be Windows 2000 or above.
